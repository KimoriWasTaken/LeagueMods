# LeagueMods
Repository for my collection of mods + WIP for mods I'm working on.
I also fix older non-updated mods if I use and like them + push them on Killerskins.com

# How to use
Clone repo as .zip (code => download as zip), extract and put the extracted "install" folder into your cslol-manager folder.
Overwriting existing files will update your skins but also use my hierarchy (Champion + Mods)
